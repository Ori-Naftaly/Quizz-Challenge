## Reflection
I wanted to experiment with different types of React applications. I love quizzes so this was a fun one to code.

What tools did you use to implement this project?
At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
